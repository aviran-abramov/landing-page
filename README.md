# Landing Page

## About

This landing page project is the _first_ project I made. This is a result of studying HTML and CSS fundamentals through [The Odin Project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/) for learning full-stack web development. This project was made right after learning Flexbox.

## Screenshots

Will be added later.
